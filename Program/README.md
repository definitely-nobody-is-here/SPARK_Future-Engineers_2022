# SPARK USEL Future Engineers Program Documentation

This is the documentation for all the source code used for the USEL Future Engineers 2022 season.

The code is divided into multiple modular files. `IO` contains source code for camera input and PWM control for throttle and steering. `Util` contains source code for development utilities and is mostly not needed for autonomous driving. `AI` contains source code for computer vision.

During matches, the `server.py` file in `Util` will not be uploaded to ensure compliance with rule 10.9
